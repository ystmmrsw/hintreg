\description{
\code{hintreg} fits a heterogeneous normal interval regression model
to interval data with an indifference limen,
i.e., a normal interval regression model with conditional heteroskedasticity
and heterogeneous indifference limen.
The dependent variable must be a factor representing J + 1 intervals,
and the user must provide thresholds below and above 0, respectively,
expect for an indifference limen (so there must be J - 2 known thresholds).
